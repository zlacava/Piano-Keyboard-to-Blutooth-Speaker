## Current Status
IN PROGRESS

## Project Overview

The end goal is to have the keyboard fully functional so that when it's powered on, it can connect to a bluetooth speaker and produce sound out of it which are the pitches that would be playing on the piano. 

## Educational Value Added

Completing this project would help me learn about the process of converting between digital and analog signals as well as the process of converting both of these signals into a wave function that has the desired frequency
of the key being pressed on the keyboard.

## Tasks

Test to see the type of signal the keyboard gives when a key is pressed (digital or ananlog)
Research the type of signal that's able to be transmited to a bluetooth speaker
Test to see the functionality of the keyboard and if all signals are working
Research a microcontroller which has specific functions depending on results of the tests above
implement the microcontroller and test if it works
